BandPage is used by musicians to share music, videos, photos, touring schedule.

== Description ==

You can think of BandPage Connect Extensions as advanced widgets — they're an extension of your photo gallery, music player, show list, bio, mailing list, and videos. Whenever you add a new show or song to BandPage, it'll automatically be updated in your WordPress sidebars or anywhere else you’ve embedded them online. 

BandPage Extensions are fully adjustable in size and support all layouts. You can select a light or dark Extension theme as well as customize their transparency to best fit the look and feel of your website or blog. Create as many Extensions as you need for your sites, then manage the content that goes on them from your BandPage.
